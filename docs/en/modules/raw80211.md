# Raw80211 Module

The raw80211 module allows sending of raw 802.11 MAC data frames.

This provides a great degree of freedom for advanced users needing to transmit custom frames. Note that the sending of management frames is *not* possible however, as the Espressif SDK blocks those.

## raw80211.send()

Sends a raw 802.11 MAC frame.

It is only possible to have one frame sent at a time. To send multiple frames, wait for the completion callback before trying to send the next.

#### Syntax
`raw80211.send(frame [, done_cb])`

#### Parameters
  - `frame` the raw frame data to send, as a binary string; must include the frame header and payload, but excludes the trailing checksum
  - `done_cb` an optional callback function to be called when the sending has completed

#### Returns
0 on success, non-zero on error.

#### Example
```lua
function send_done(status)
  print(status)
end
raw80211.send(frame, status)
```
