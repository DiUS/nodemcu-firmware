# Work-in-Progress NodeMCU

This repo is the development repo for various NodeMCU bits we
use here at DiUS.  Branches come and go, as do bugs. Unless you
are a DiUS employee who needs to use some of the DiUS specific
features, you are better off using the
[official NodeMCU repo](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/).
We frequently submit features and fixes upstream to the `dev` branch.

There is also some module documentation available on the
[Wiki](https://github.com/DiUS/nodemcu-firmware/wiki), which may not
have been pulled into the upstream wiki.
